You are given an integer n. You need to check if the number is a perfect number or not. Return true if it is a perfect number, otherwise, return false.

A perfect number is a number whose proper divisors (excluding the number itself) add up to the number itself.

Examples:
1. Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3.
1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

2. Input: n = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Proper divisors of 4 are 1, 2.
1 + 2 = 3.
