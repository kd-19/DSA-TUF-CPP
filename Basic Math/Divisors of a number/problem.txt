You are given an integer n. You need to find all the divisors of n. Return all the divisors of n as an array or list in a sorted order.

A number which completely divides another number is called it's divisor.

Examples:
1. Input: n = 6
Output = [1, 2, 3, 6]
Explanation: The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

2. Input: n = 8
Output: [1, 2, 4, 8]
Explanation: The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.
