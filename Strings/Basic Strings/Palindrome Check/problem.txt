You are given a string s. Return true if the string is palindrome, otherwise false.

A string is called palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:
1. Input : s = "hannah"
Output : true
Explanation :
The given string when read backward is -> "hannah", which is same as when read forward.
Hence answer is true.

2. Input : s = "aabbaaa"
Output : false
Explanation :
The given string when read backward is -> "aaabbaa", which is not same as when read forward.
Hence answer is false
